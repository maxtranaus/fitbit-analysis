The Fitbit Report provide a user-friendly interface and offer the following views:

### Home Dashboard
- The number of users who used the device for a full day was higher when they first bought it but decreased significantly over time, especially within the second month. The number of users using the device for half of the day remained stable. The number of users using the device for less than 8 hours increased significantly in the following month.
- There is a positive correlation between the number of steps walked and the calories burnt. The more steps taken, the more calories burnt.
- Most users spend 7 to 8 hours sleeping.
- There is an inverse relationship between activity minutes and the time spent sleeping. The fewer minutes users spend on activities, the more time they spend asleep.
